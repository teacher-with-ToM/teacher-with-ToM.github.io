        <h1>Utility-based Adaptive Teaching Strategies using Bayesian Theory of Mind</h1>
        <p>Good teachers always tailor their explanations to the learners. Cognitive scientists model this process under the rationality principle: 
			teachers try to maximise the learner's utility while minimising teaching costs. To this end, human teachers seem to build mental models 
			of the learner's internal state, a capacity known as Theory of Mind (ToM). Inspired by cognitive science, we build on Bayesian ToM mechanisms 
			to design machine teachers that, like humans, tailor their teaching strategies to the learners. Our ToM-equipped teachers construct models of 
			learners' internal states from observations and leverage them to select demonstrations that maximise the learners' rewards while minimising teaching costs. 
			Our experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that learners taught this way are more efficient than those taught in a learner-agnostic way. 
			This effect gets stronger when the teacher's model of the learner better aligns with the actual learner's state, either using a more accurate prior or 
			after accumulating observations of the learner's behaviour. This work is a first step towards social machines that teach us and each other.

            <h1><a href="#" class="left-header">Our work</a></h1>
            <p>In our paper, we compare the utility of demonstrations selected by ToM-teachers with demonstrations selected 
                by teachers who use learner-agnostic approaches. Learner-agnostic teachers do not leverage the observations of the learner's 
                behaviour in the simple environment to tailor their demonstration selections to the specific observed learner. We also
                 investigate the limits of ToM-teachers' ability to recover the actual learner's internal state, either due to inaccurate priors 
                 about the learner's behavioural policy or limited observation of the learner's 
                 behaviour in the simple environment.</p>
